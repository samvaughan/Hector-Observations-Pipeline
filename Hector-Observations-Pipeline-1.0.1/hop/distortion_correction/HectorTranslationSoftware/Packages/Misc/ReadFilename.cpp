//  Function:
//    ReadFilename() prompts for a filename and returns one entered by the user
//
//  Description:
//    ReadFilename() provides a way for a command line program - ie one run
//    from a terminal - to prompt the user for the name of a file. What makes
//    this more than just a "write a prompt, read a line" routine is that it
//    supports filename completion. For full details, see the comments at the
//    start of ReadFilename.h

//  This is ReadFilename() itself. It outputs the prompt that it
//  is passed, then sets the terminal into non-canonical/no echo mode so it
//  has control voer what the user sees, as opposed to just echoing characters
//  as they're typed, and starts to read characters from the user. It handles
//  TAB and ^D characters to provide filename completion, and finally
//  returns the entered filename. If all goes well, it returns zero, but
//  can return -1 to indicate an error changing the terminal mode.
//
//    Prompt is a C-style character string, nul-terminated, that is output
//           as a prompt to the user. Normally, it would be something along
//           the lines of "Enter filename: ".
//    Line   is the address of the start of an array of char, into which the
//           resulting file specification, entered by the user, is returned.
//           It will always be terminated by a final nul character.
//    Len    is the number of bytes in the Line array - it will normally
//           be just sizeof(Line).

//  CheckTilde() is simply some common code needed by HandleTab() and
//  HandleCtrlD(), both of which have to handle the way glob() deals with
//  file specifications beginning with '~'. If glob() is passed the GLOB_TILDE
//  flag - as it is by this routine - it recognises the '~user/' as the home
//  directory of the named user, and '~/' as the home directory of the
//  current user. However, it take it upon itslelf to expand these into the
//  absolute file path when it returns the list of matching files, which is
//  useful, but not what's really wanted here. This routine assumes the Line
//  it is passed starts with one of these '~' specifications, and returns
//  the index in Line just after that first delimiting '/'. and also returns
//  the index of the character in the paths returned by glob() just after
//  the expansion of that '~' string. That's messy, but an example may help:
//
//  If my user name is 'fred' and my home directory is '/Users/fred/', then
//  if I pass '~fred/myfile*' to glob, glob will return results like:
//  '/Users/fred/myfile.o'
//  '/Users/fred/myfile.cpp'
//  etc.
//  Rather than have the user suddenly see the '~fred' that was typed
//  suddenly turn into '/Users/fred'. we'd like to be able to restore the
//  original '~' form. To do that, we need to know how many characters of
//  the paths returned by glob() need to be replaced by how many characters
//  in the original spec. In this case, the first 6 characters ('~fred/') of
//  the original spec need to replace the first 12 characters ('/Users/fred/')
//  of the paths returned by glob().
//
//  It's those two counts that CheckTilde() works out. In this case, it
//  will set LineSt to 6 and PathSt to 12. It's then up to the calling
//  routine to make use of that information.

   o There is little reason for this to be in C++ rather than C, other than
     the convenience of C++ comments, being able to use bool, and being able
     to declare variables just before needing to use them. But that seems
     enough. Basically, though, the code is C. I even wondered if the .h
     file should use C-style comments and declare ReadFile() as extern 'C'.
     In the end, I didn't see the point.
 
   o Ignoring '*' characters is a bit of a cop-out. They could be handled
     using glob(), but it's complicated. Maybe in a later version? (The main
     issue is how to mke sure what the user sees is actually correct.)
 
   o This doesn't provide line editing using cursor keys, but if a cursor
     key is pressed the results aren't really what's expected. It would be
     nice to trap and ignore cursor keys, but since these generate key
     sequences rather than a single character, that's been put off for a
     later version as well.
